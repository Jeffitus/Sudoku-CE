# Sudoku CE

By Jeffitus
 
This is a Sudoku game for TI-CE (ez80) calculators.

Written in C using the community libraries and toolchain.

Check out the Cemetech topic [here](https://ceme.tech/t16261). 

## Building
You can build this using the [CE C toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain). Follow the instructions there to install, then enter `make` when you are in the \Sudoku-CE\ directory.

## How to play
Use the arrow keys and 2nd to navigate and select options in menus. You can also use clear to quit or go back. In-game, use the arrow keys to move around the grid, the numpad to enter a number in the selected cell, and graph to toggle the pencil mode. If the pencil in the botton right of the screen is filled in blue, pencil mode is activated. The game will automatically check if you have won when the grid is filled.

## Credits
This game was made by Jeffitus, with some help from MateoConLechuga and jacobly on the Cemetech forums. Also, thanks to DrDnar for his ce-fonts repository, where I found the main font used for this game.
